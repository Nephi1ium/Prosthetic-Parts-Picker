Add a function to each click of a button, adding the choice to an array. 
Within the "cart", cancelling the selection of that item will access another function which deletes the array item.
Last, the array will be associated with certain values, which will fill out certain fields of a PDF document.

function changeColor4() {
            document.querySelector('#textToChange').style.color = 'green';
        }

this may be a great way to access each item. The "#textToChange" is the id and the ".style.color = 'green'"
ist hte CSS modifier. It could be used to run another JS function too, as in to do the above- select and add the choice to the cart. 
WILL NEED TO LOOK AT querySelectorall()

using this -
while (parentNode.firstChild) {
    parentNode.removeChild(parentNode.firstChild);
}
This will remove the child of the parent node. Set the parent node first, 
then you can use that as the "delete selection" method for the cart. The more effective mthod may be- parentNode.firstElementChild
It will be very important to set a function to reload the page on either a "delete selection" choice, or more safely a "confirm deletion" popup, on screen.
