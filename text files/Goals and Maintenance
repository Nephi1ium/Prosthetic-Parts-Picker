Need to redo the navigator for the all items to be displayed. 8.24.22
            For example- I need to create a class that each item holding section (ie. mpkKneeSection) is called via one function, with general information being passed by clicking the associated button. This will greatly cut down on the amount of syntax that needs to be typed. 

Need to put all of the items- Liners, Feet, Knees, Components into a unique Javascript File. The final form will be to turn each card item into an array item, and a general framework can be created in order to create each unique card item on clicking of the associated button. 8.24.22
