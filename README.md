Choosing the correct items and processes has never been easier. Simply select the items you need and everything will be added to a PDF file for email. 

This is an unpublished project. The majority of the items are present, and functionality is at around 80%. Some issues persist, such as improper PDF document creation with inadequate formatting. Other necessary quality of life issues are in the realm of grid formatting of all display port items, as I work to remove any bootstrap in my project for easer of upkeep. A favorites section utilizing Local Storage is in the works. As it stands, the items and information on all prosthetic items is in array format and will show on the display with appropriate selection of navigation items.
